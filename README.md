## Description 

This project I was instructed to create a password generator. The generator takes into account characters such as Uppercase, Lowercase, Special, and Nmmbers.
When the button is clicked the user chooses the length of the password, and confirms wether or not they would like each of these characters included.
The end product is posted into the box so that the user can use this generated password and copy it.
